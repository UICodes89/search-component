#Search Result
currently, I kept a JSON file which has a user list every time you type something in the input field, it will fetch result based on the string you type with matching data with JSON list

#search item
you can start typing a, an or any other string every string you type it will fetch value for that.



# Implementation

I have used Angular 1.5.6 with css3 flexbox, I have written sass for CSS, for now, I have uploaded a converted file in CSS form. no need to compile, bootstrap3. it's a component based structure.Node Js latest version with npm and node-saas installed other wise gulp scss command will not work.
